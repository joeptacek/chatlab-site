  <hr />
  <p>Our lab is a part of the Center for Cognitive Neuroscience within the University of Pennsylvania Neurology Department. We are interested in interactions between cognition, language, and the brain. Our studies cover a diverse range of cognitive processes, including figurative and spatial language, event representation, aesthetics, neuroethics. Much of our research focuses on differences in processing of patients with brain injury, compared with healthy adults.</p>
