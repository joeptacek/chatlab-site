    position: Doctoral Candidate
    bio: I am a Ph.D. candidate from University of Pennsylvania Department of Philosophy. My research focuses on the nature of human experience, and how cognitive neuroscience sheds light on this issue. Topics that I am working on include how we should understand the transition from perceptual experience to perceptual judgment and whether we can perceptually experience aesthetic properties.
