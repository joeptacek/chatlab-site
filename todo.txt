- cache indvalidation!

- consider using microformats / microdata (schema.org) for citations, addresses

- use js to filter news results, move twitter to news page

- encircle social icons

- cv: on mobile, break onto another line?

- create a more abstract class to do layout for people-item, news-item, book-item, contact-item etc

- typography: make certain elements sans (e.g., h1, h2, nav anchors, logos, icons, ui stuff etc), keep "content" serif

- url stuff: using .htaccess and rewriting engine to avoid html extension https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5730092/how-to-remove-html-from-url/5730126#5730126

- url stuff: best practice is to add index.html to each directory (e.g., news)

- url stuff: use redirects for news pages?

- add 404

- stamp git commit info into jekyll output? eg as comment at top of body? as txt file?

- change permissions on server dirs like backups

- add meta description

- add old htm tests in research

- add old supplemental materials in research

- add CVs

- mobile nav site links and button should be width 100%

- mobile nav-page style should be different/should not be a card?

- mobile nav site links should jump down past logos

- fix mobile nav site spacing (more at top?)

- link to github from copyright?

- research: add section with our downloadable tasks

- research: show descriptions, hide publications under button

- add contact / social links to anjan's section on main page

- fix scrolling for twitter widget on mobile, includfe link to that twitter list

- changed a bunch of src="" and href="" to remove preceding slash. used href="index.html" instead of just "/". why doesn't slash prefix work for href and src when serving from hosting.med.upenn.edu?

- needed to prepend /chatterjee/ to css links in head so that these assets would be found regardless of whether on /chatterjee/XXXX.html or /chatterjee/news/XXXX.html

- needed to prepend /chatterjee/ to news links (e.g., news/audio.html) so these wouldn't try going to /chatterjee/news/news/XXXX.html

- mobile improvements: smaller padding, bigger text

- improve image appearance and performance. explore @2x, high resolution images, responsive images, picture element / srcset / webp polyfills, etc

- get rid of extra svg defs

- better close menu button

- pdf icons

- sections should be expandable: research, about anjan

- missing stuff: anjan CV! path manner 007 video!

- get people's: CV, IG account, GitHub account, other accounts?

- favicon: see wharton for good one. possible to just use a icon larger than 32px? seems like browser knows how to deal with this

- google analytics

- use higher resolution images than 200?

- ?????

- PDF UNAVAILABLE

- favicon: move middle circle up? fix colors (e.g., make red more pinkish raspberry)?

- add anjan departmental page link?

- why doesn't jump to top button trigger css transition

- add subtle background texture?

- collect ig / flickr accounts from lab members

- improve twitter / media situation: ok on media page? twitter sidebar (per anjan?)

- new email addresses!

- fix screwed up titles in media section!!!

- format addresses in some sort of blockquote thing

- links to indiv twitter accounts from twitter box

- highlight active section in page nav while scrolling

- highlight current page in site nav

- reorganize css (pare down unnecessary classes esp in items)

- add footer!

- animate: jump-up-box, scroll (e.g., to top, to sections), menu open / close

- bring back home link on menu?

- switch menu toggle to top of menu

- add jump to top fixed button on mobile

- clicking link to page sections should leave gap at top

- play around with

- classes: eliminate specificity in items (e.g., book-item, people-item); just use generic "item" class and create / use additional helper classes (e.g., item-align-center) where necessary

- more space under book items, contact items

- parallax background image? schema icons?

- links to social profiles: maybe just put username in data, build href from base url

- include icons for PDFs

- confirm target _blank for all links

- figure out better attribution for icomoon svgs (including font awesome subset)

- make height of filter section on news the same as other pages where there is h2 (subtle parallel)

- use <cite> for other titles (e.g. books, articles etc)

- use more align-items: stretch instead of center for columns?

- there shouldn't be top or bottom padding on html (should be inherent in header / footer)

- each news item = separate card?

- play with max-width on news text, people text? not research text.

- play with page-nav styles on mobile (not card? collapsable card?)

- button styling in site-nav a little off compared to links?

- multiple video links in old media section (one for img, one for text) - investigate? clue to missing haverford link?

- on nav-page: top section link should jump all the way to the top of the page (not just to first section)

- while scrolling, highlight current page section on nav-page

- be careful about over-nesting with scss (consider the rendered css; see:
  http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule
  https://www.sitepoint.com/beware-selector-nesting-sass/

- Add follow / tweet links

- add books

- add anjan specific page?

- get local copy of psom logo

- clarify scrollability of twitter-div

- js at end of body or in head? jury is out

- clarify SVG parameters

- fix punctuation (e.g., quotes / apostrophes) in bios.

- search center for neuroscience and society website for additional articles
  (and videos!) of anjan... "a clinician looks at enhancement," "the aesthetic
  brain" ...

- intermix video / audio / print article ordering (all by date)

- news page collapses horizontally according to maximum content width

- date_year should be YYYY not YY

- Deal with missing news links (e.g., Haverford video)

- Keep adding videos (next: )

- Convert numeric months to words

- Media platform / show / event: Title
  Media publisher, date

  Example:
  CNS Blog: Beauty Is in the Brain of the Beholder
  CNS, 1/21/15

  CNS Conference 2015: xxx

  Mural Blog: xxx
  BPS Research Digest
  Psychology Today Blog
  BioLogos Blogs
  etc.

- Title case = AP style or...? See titlecase.com, check news.yml for
  inconsistencies (e.g., "with" vs "With")... prefer more uppercasey AP style?

- for news, null date_day is ok

- Keep working on fixing strings. All should be in single quotes. Next to do:

- supplemental content (e.g. corrections, tests)

- generally: try to eventually update citations for advance online pubs

- em dash, en dash, hyphen

- fix null dates and urls for media

- null or ~

- Things to be careful about with single-quoting strings: Single quotes inside
  single quotes need to be duplicated (e.g., '' for ') - but remember to use
  curly quotes (‘’) whenever needed (including apostrophes). Other special
  characters (e.g., " \ / : -) should be rendered correctly inside single
  quotes. Can use double quotes for strings containing non-printable / control
  escape sequences (e.g., \n produces a line break), or really any arbitrary
  unicode. To make backslash in double quotes, must use \x5c.

- For special characters including apostrophes, curly quotes, umlauts, etc.,
  OK to use the rendered unicode character itself (e.g., alt + [ for “ on
  macOS), since HTML encoding here is utf-8. Alternatively, can use named or
  numeric entities (e.g., &ldquo; or &8220;) but this is less readable.

  Opening double quote U+201C (“): alt-[ / &ldquo; / &8220;
  Closing double quote U+201D (”): alt-shift-[ / &rdquo; / &8221;
  Opening single quote U+2018 (‘): alt-] &lsquo; / &8216;
  Closing double quote / apostrophe U+2019 (’): alt-shift-] / &rsquo; &8217;
  Lowercase o with diaeresis U+00F6 (ö): alt-u then o / &ouml; &246;

- Quotes needed with colons (yes), dashes (yes), commas (?),
  double quotes (yes?), apostrophes (no?), &?

- Consider fancy quotes and apostrophes

- YAML file header --- ?

- Use quotes on all strings? (SINGLE QUOTES)

- Set the order

- Fix umlauts

- Clarify null vs nil

- Clarify what to do with conference proceedings publisher / location

- Deal with case where ultimately no PDF is available

- Fix journal titles (e.g., Aesthetics instead of American Society for
 Aesthetics)

- Drugs to build a better brain is a book review

- Issue expressed as range (e.g., for Schizophrenia Research article: 2-3).
  Fixed. Only including first number in range (e.g., 2) so that data type for
  journal_vol can remain numberic. For schizophrenia article, issue data in
  various format of exported citation show issue as 2. Seems that this journal
  tends to always publish a varying number of actual issues per volume, but
  names these as follows: 1-3 for one issue; 1-2 and 3 (or 1 and 2-3) for two
  issues; 1 and 2 and 3 for three issues. So it seems appropriate to refer to
  issue 2-3 as 2 since this is in fact the second issue in the series.

- DOI formatting style? with https://doi.org prepended?

- Dealing with point-counterpoint style article in journal (e.g., see BMJ
 article on methylphenidate). Just cite as ordinary article? Do something
 similar to letters to editor?

- Dealing with letters to editor (e.g., see "correspondence" with Nature).
  Maybe just keep the formatting out of the template (i.e., work_title
  includes "[Letter to editor]")

- Check for single quote / apostrophe weirdness

- Check for missing PDFs

- Figure out how Frontiers should be cited. Exported citation from the
  Frontiers website suggests that "article number" is page(s). A Stack
  Exchange post offers possible rationalle: article number is sort of an
  appropriate digital proxy for pages in a print publication. Or would it make
  more sense to indicate "article number" as issue, as suggested in comment
  on APA blog post? The APA blog post itself suggests reporting just the
  volume and page range, no article number. Currently, including article
  number as "issue" in Frontiers articles.
  see: https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/13534/what-is-the-volume-of-this-article-in-a-journal
       http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2015/05/how-to-cite-an-article-with-an-article-number-instead-of-a-page-range.html

- Confirm that null issue data is actually null

- Check that ALL content from old site is transferred (e.g., links to
  supplemental materials, links to tests published on site)

- Check that DOI formats are consistent (e.g., all lowercase, no full urls,
  etc.)

- Clarify: only DOIs for journals? UPDATE: at least one non-journal has DOI
  (see: "...growing pains of a new discipline..."). For physical books that
  also have a  DOI, maybe just show the standard publisher / location info
  without DOI. At least one periodical doesn't have DOI (American Society for
  Aesthetics newsletter)

- Restructure advance online publication case? Perhaps include journal_vol,
  journal_issue, and journal_pages under journal_edition_data. If
  advance_tf is true, just set journal_edition_data to null.

- Clarify ambiguous vol / issue / page numbers and DOIs

- Flesh out APA styleguide and YAML styleguide

- Check out YAML Lint standards (need triple dash at top of file? OK to
  format a list of dicts without newline after list item dash?)

- Fix mappings where value contains colon: wrap problematic values in quotes.
  Just use quotes for all mapping values, even when unnecessary?
  work_title: Aptness and beauty in metaphor << Fine without quotes
  work_title: "Narratives of focal brain injured individuals: A macro-level analysis" << Needs quotes to avoid problems

APA STYLEGUIDE

- Titles appear in sentence case (only first word / proper nouns capitalized).
  First word of subtitle after colon is capatalized.

- Journal author list is separated by commas. Last name then first initial
  with period. Oxford comma after penultimate name, ampersand symbol instead
  of "and."

- Journal title should be title case (major words capitalized). Do not
  abbreviate journals (exceptions, so far: "PLOS ONE" and ""). Preserve
  punctuation style.

- Editors of edited work and authors of works under review should be indicated
  as first initial, middle initial, last name. Include "(Eds.)" or "(Ed.)"
  after final name, depending if there are one or multiple editors.

YAML STYLEGUIDE / LOGICGUIDE

- If work_title or journal_title (or any other value in a mapping) contains a
  colon (":"), need to escape this by surrounding the whole value with quotes
  (e.g., "Title: This is the subtitle"). Technically, all values that function
  as strings CAN be in quotes - but especially necessary here.

- Exclude period from end of title, include question / exclamation mark.
  Template should insert period unless special punctuation is present.

- If work_publication_format is article_in_journal, edited_work_data should be
  null (vice versa when work_publication_format is article_in_edited_work).

- For work in a journal, journal_vol and journal_pages are necessary, but
  journal_issue is optional (not all journals use issues).

- Edited work types so far (use lowercase): book, conference.

- Reviewed work types so far (use lowercase): book.

- Probably: A work is either from a journal or from an edited work.

- Probably: If a advance_tf is true, journal_vol, journal_issue, and
  journal_pages should all be null.
